- **Xylose Concentration**: R¬≤ = 0.645 (Moderate linear predictability)
- **Cellobiose Concentration**: R¬≤ = 0.469 (Lower linear predictability)

### Output Variability
- **Glucose**: CV = 0.681 (Medium variability)
- **Xylose**: CV = 0.668 (Medium variability)
- **Cellobiose**: CV = 0.812 (High variability - most complex output)

### Information Entropy
- **Xylose**: 3.260 bits (highest entropy - most unpredictable)
- **Glucose**: 3.166 bits (high entropy)
- **Cellobiose**: 2.877 bits (lower entropy - more predictable patterns)

### Temporal Dependencies
Strong non-linear relationships with time detected:
- **Cellobiose**: +0.308 improvement with polynomial features (most non-linear)
- **Xylose**: +0.210 improvement
- **Glucose**: +0.159 improvement

## üéØ Complexity Assessment

### Overall Complexity: **HIGH**

**Contributing Factors:**
- High-dimensional input space (6 variables)
- High output variability (avg CV = 0.72)
- High information entropy in outputs
- Significant temporal non-linearities

### Modeling Recommendations

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Linear models with polynomial time features

   - Interaction terms between key variables
   - Time-based derived features

3. **Validation Strategy**:
   - Use cross-validation for model selection
   - Implement regularization to prevent overfitting
   - Consider time-series validation approaches
